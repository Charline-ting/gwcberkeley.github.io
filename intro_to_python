CS61A is the first class where most Berkeley students get in touch with coding, and learning python a major part of this class.
Here we would lay out key knowledge points of learning python by each section and representive coding practices in CS61A for you to check out!
The order of this book would follow CS61A, so it's convenient to use this to check your understandings of each section.
