# GWC Meeting Chaos

In a GWC meeting in another parallel universe where we can meet in person, there are 100 attendees and everyone is assigned a seat,
numbered from 1 to 100. The person who is assigned seat 1 decides to pick a seat randomly from the 100 seatsğŸ¤¯ For the rest of attendees,
if their seats are taken, they pick a random available seat; if their assigned seats are available, they choose  the assigned seats.

What is the probability that the last attendee gets its assigned seat?
